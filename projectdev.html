                <br>
                <p>
                    The idea of the project came from wanting to do something that I've never done before with software, that being a bot, since I've always been keen on automation and I use discord every day for a few years and wanted to see what is possible to do with their bot technology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially I wanted to create the bot on Python, but setting up the enviornment proved to be too difficult and I decided to switch to JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After deciding I wanted to work on JS, I started planning what the bot should do. Initially I wanted it to be a crypto currency bot (a bot that shows prices of coins), but that felt unfulfilling, so I scrapped that idea and decided I will make it a moderation bot with some fun functions. I tried adding music to it, but the dependencies seemed to be broken for a while and could not find a proper fix to this issue, so the bot will most likely not have music. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Things went pretty well while developing, there are plenty of sources online (like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>  or <a href="https://dbotmaker.io/forums/">discord forums</a> ). Nevertheless I had moments where I got demotivated whenever I got stuck on something and could not figure out how to fix it, but I pushed onward with the idea and I think it payed off. The most challenging part was figuring out how discord.js works and how to properly use the Discord Development portal and also figuring out what's the range of possibility when it comes to the bot. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After I got comfortable with using these tools, I started getting inspired from already existings bots like <a href="https://mee6.xyz/">MEE6</a> for example. I firsly started working on the !clear command which allows the bot to clear/delete up to 100 messages in a text chat. After that, I had to figure out how to exclude regular users from using such command, since only admins should be allowed to do such operations. After figuring that out, I began working on the !kick, !ban and !mute commands, which the mute command proved to be the most challening one since I wanted it to have the option of temporary mutes (e.g. !mute @user 5s) and it mutes them for 5 seconds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then I worked on auto-assigning user roles whever someone joins the server, and giving a welcome message in a special text channel. I also decided to add some fun commands like !joke for example, this command will send you a unique "dad joke" via an API call. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will be working on a snake game and some other fun commands before the 12th Mar and hopefully they will be working as intended and I can demostrate them to the teachers on Friday.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall I feel like I achieved my milestone for this 3-4 week long project, and I think I have improved my JS skill toolbelt. I have also started looking at tech in a more creative way and my vision for it has expanded more copmpared to 4 weeks ago. My class mates contributed to that after sharing their projects and I got to see their creative ideas and visions.
