                <h3>Introduction to Creative Technology</h3>
                <br>
                <p>We watched a documentary with the entire class about creativity.
                  <br> 
                We agreed that the project should change the way people do something.
              <br>
              Geert told us to track our creativity during the day.

                <br>
                <p>I created my Git repo for the discord bot, created an arduino project for the lecture that Ronald gave us.

                <h1>Brainstorming sessions with breakout rooms </h1>
                <p>We discussed ideas for the individual project and what our goal for this semester is. We got seperated in break out rooms where we discussed ideas.

                <br>
                I had a few ideas:
                <br>
                1.Discord bot (which I chose to go for)
                <br>
                2. E-commerce website

                <h1>What is a vision?</h1>
                <p>We had a brainstorm session where we discussed if technology can change the way people think and/or interact with it and what effects it might or might not have on humanity.
                  <br>
                  We all created vision boards, and I was unsure what it meant so I missed the mark on it, but this is what it looks like:

                </p>
                <br>
                My top 3 tech innovators:
                <br>
                1. Gabe Newell
                <br>
                2. Elon Musk
                <br>

                  <h1>Aviici project workshop </h1>
                  <p>We were invited to participate in a very interesting workshop demostrating vizualization of songs, movies or text and what the emotion was behind it. (If the text is sad,happy,etc)
                    <br>
                    I did the whole album from the artist The Weeknd - Starboy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is what I came up with:

                    We also learned how to dropship items via RedBubble.com

                  <h1>Workshop on creative manifest </h1>
                  <p>I talked to my teacher about my project and they gave me some ideas and I started excuting upon them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the workshop I learned that a manifest is a short list of rules or visions of a way of being.
                    <br>
                    We read articles about creative tech and discussed within eachother in breakout rules, we also combined the manifest lines from each of the breakout groups into 1 big one for the next people that decide to go for Creative Tech.
                    <br>
                    The article we read could be found <a href="https://medium.com/@laserpilot/advice-for-creative-technologists-21f3f220b2">here</a>.

                  <h1>Started working on research and implementation on my individual project</h1>
                  <p>
                    I started researching on how discordJS works, what dependencies I will need, and overall how to create a discord bot.
                    <br>
                    Initially I wanted to use Python for my project, since most bots outside of discord are also created in python.  
                    <br>
                    The set up proved to be harder than I expected it, and the enviornment did not want to work properly on my computer, and I decided to switch to JavaScript, since I already have NodeJS on my computer ready to go, and I have limited time to work on the project and did not want to be stuck in a loop of trying to fix Python.

                  <h1>Workshop on how to learn new technology </h1>
                  <p>
                    The workshop helped me realise how much tech is around us and we don't even notice it.
                    <br>
                    Doing technology research helps us make a believable story to the client/users and gives substance to the project.

                    I had a semester coach meeting with Geert Ouwendorp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Started working on my discord bot, and decided that I would like to make it a moderation bot, meaning that a Administrator of an already existing server can you is for various operations! (e.g Temporary mute, Ban, Unban, Kick, Perma Mutes, Timed Mutes etc.)

                  <h1>Workshop on prototyping </h1>
                  <p>
                    We learned that attaching ourselves to prototypes can prove to be bad, so we should focus on making them quick and simple.
                    There can be multiple types of prototypes, some for functionality and some for design depending on your poject.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We made a paper plane prototype as an example.

                  <p>
                    Our teacher explained what we need to have ready for Wednesday and Friday, I also had some questions about what my portfolio should look like and some of the students gave me ideas in the chat.

                    <br>
                    I started working on creating this web-page that you are currently on and continued working on my discord bot, adding more benefitial features, like listening to music, and giving the bot a little bit of "life", so when you ask it for a !joke, it will send you a unique joke in the chat.
