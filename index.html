            <h3>Introduction to Creative Technology</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We watched a documentary with the entire class about creativity.
              <br>
              We agreed that the project should change the way people do something.
              <br>
              Geert told us to track our creativity during the day.

            <h3>IOT introduction and working with Arduino</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I created my Git repo for the discord bot, created an arduino project for the lecture that Ronald gave
              us.

            <h1>Brainstorming sessions with breakout rooms </h1>
            <p>We discussed ideas for the individual project and what our goal for this semester is. We got seperated in
              break out rooms where we discussed ideas.

              <br>
              I had a few ideas:
              <br>
              1.Discord bot (which I chose to go for)
              <br>
              2. E-commerce website

            <h1>What is a vision?</h1>
            <p>We had a brainstorm session where we discussed if technology can change the way people think and/or
              interact with it and what effects it might or might not have on humanity. I also learned that a vision
              statement should be a concrete way for stakeholders to understand the meaning and purpose of your idea.
              <br>
              We all created vision boards, and I was unsure what it meant so I missed the mark on it, but this is what
              it looks like:

            <h1>Aviici project workshop </h1>
            <p>We were invited to participate in a very interesting workshop demonstrating visualization of songs,
              movies or text and what the emotion was behind it. (If the text is sad,happy,etc)
              <br>
              I did the whole album from the artist The Weeknd - Starboy.
              <br>
              <br>
              This is what I came up with:

            We also learned how to dropship items via RedBubble.com and I got to broaden my creative vision with the

            <h1>Workshop on creative manifest </h1>
            <p>I talked to my teacher about my project and they gave me some ideas and I started excuting upon them.
              <br>
              <br>
              During the workshop I learned that a manifest is a short list of rules or visions of a way of being.
              <br>
              We read articles about creative tech and discussed within eachother in breakout rules, we also combined
              the manifest lines from each of the breakout groups into 1 big one for the next people that decide to go
              for Creative Tech.
              <br>

            <h1>Started working on research and implementation on my individual project</h1>
            <p>
              I started researching on how discordJS works, what dependencies I will need, and overall how to create a
              discord bot.
              <br>
              Initially I wanted to use Python for my project, since most bots outside of discord are also created in
              python.
              <br>
              The set up proved to be harder than I expected it, and the enviornment did not want to work properly on my
              computer, and I decided to switch to JavaScript, since I already have NodeJS on my computer ready to go,
              and I have limited time to work on the project and did not want to be stuck in a loop of trying to fix
              Python.

            <h1>Workshop on how to learn new technology </h1>
            <p>
              The workshop helped me realise how much tech is around us and we don't even notice it.
              <br>
              Doing technology research helps us make a believable story to the client/users and gives substance to the
              project.
              <br>
              <br>
              I had a semester coach meeting with Geert Ouwendorp.
              <br>
              <br>
              Started working on my discord bot, and decided that I would like to make it a moderation bot, meaning that
              a Administrator of an already existing server can you is for various operations! (e.g Temporary mute, Ban,
              Unban, Kick, Perma Mutes, Timed Mutes etc.)

            <h1>Workshop on prototyping </h1>
            <p>
              We learned that attaching ourselves to prototypes can prove to be bad, so we should focus on making them
              quick and simple.
              There can be multiple types of prototypes, some for functionality and some for design depending on your
              poject.
              <br>
              <br>
              We made a paper plane prototype as an example.

              Our teacher explained what we need to have ready for Wednesday and Friday, I also had some questions about
              what my portfolio should look like and some of the students gave me ideas in the chat.
              <br>
              <br>
              I started working on creating this web-page that you are currently on and continued working on my discord
              bot, adding more benefitial features, like listening to music, and giving the bot a little bit of "life",
              so when you ask it for a !joke, it will send you a unique joke in the chat.

              <br>
              <br>
              I recieved feedback on my portfolio and worked on it, creating a seperate page explaining my development
              process and adding more substance to the timeline part of the portfolio.
              <br>
              <br>
              I also had a feedback session with Erik and showed him what I've worked on, giving him a demo. He liked it
              and had some questions regarding permissions and who/how/what can use the bot. I gave him a detailed
              explenation and he liked the project overall and told me to keep up the good job.

            <h1>Overview of the first phase of my duo project with Daan</h1>
            <p>
              During the first phase it was a bit chaotic trying to find a duo mate, because I was matched with 3
              different people and a 4th person was also added later on.
              <br>
              <br>
              I listened to the other people's ideas and came to a consensus that I want to work with Daan.
              <br>
              <br>
              We started thinking about what we wanted to work on. I thought of 2 ideas: Gesture keyboard,
              eye-tracking keyboard, both of which can help impaired people with typing on a PC. Daan suggested a complimenting mirror and after further discussions we decided to go ahead with the mirror.
              <br>
              <br>
              We started brain storming on what we want to create and Daan came up with a sketch for it:
            <div class="imageContainer">

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/daan-sketch.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>


              After more discussions we decided we wanted to present this idea to our teachers on friday and showed them
              an example:
            </p>
            <div class="imageContainer">

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/example.png" alt="">
            </div>
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3 class="date">2nd phase of Duo project</h3>
            <h1>Overview of the second phase of my duo project with Daan</h1>
            <p>
              During the second phase we wasted no time and started working on prototyping.
              <br>
              We started gaining inspirations from different mirror examples, like such:
            <div class="imageContainer">

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/inspiration1.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/inspiration2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>


              Meanwhile I started researching how we would like to detect people and we decided that face-recognition
              might be our best solution.
              <br>
              I was thinking of using OpenCV but then I found this easy to use neat JavasCript face-recognition api
              called face-api.js and you could do many things with it.
              <br>
              For example it assumes your age and/or facial expressions:
            </p>
            <div class="imageContainer">

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/img.jpg" alt="">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/image1.jpg" alt="">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/image2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>

              In the image above you can see an example of me using the api and calibrating it so it detects my smile
              and after that it "sends that smile" to the datbase.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

              Meanwhile Daan created a lo-fi prototype:
            </p>
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/daan-lofi.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>


              <br>
              After seeing this prototype we started thinking how we should implement the camera and we decided to use 2
              cameras. One for the face detection and one for the "mirror", which will only show the reflection of the
              person.
              <br>
              I also made the face detection send out a compliment whenver it detects someone with a 95% confidence.
              <br>
              Here is an example of someone using it:
            </p>
            <div class="imageContainer">

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/daan-family-member.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>

              The laptop has the recognition softawre, while the tablet is the "mirror" and that's the only thing the
              user will actually be exposed to.
            </p>
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3 class="date">3rd phase of Duo project</h3>
            <h1>Overview of the third phase of my duo project with Daan</h1>
            <p>
              During this phase I have worked on creating an architecture diagrams folllowing the c4 model.
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/c4-1.png" alt="">

            </div>
            <p>
              I have also made it so everytime the user's face is recognized, the speakers send a random compliment
              (from 10 choices)
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/random_compliment.png" alt="">

            </p>
            <p>
              Due to misconception over if I have worked on deisgning the prototypes, I have created a sketch of what I
              pitched to Daan, on what the prototype should look like. I should have added it to earlier phases in
              reality since we came up with it a week ago, however I did not know that I needed to actually show it to
              the teachers.
              <br>
              This is what we orignially had:
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/daan-sketch.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
              And this is what I proposed we should be using:

              software decisions.

            <h1>Overview of the third phase of my duo project with Daan</h1>
            <p>
              During this phase we fixed the compliment spam. I created the use-case and also the activity diagram for
              the project, and helped Daan with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-suCT9KZ3FvZ5rQomQjr-uoV5-ePemeAvPXlWaoQnA/edit?usp=sharing">Test Plan.</a>

            </p>

            <p>
              We also switched up our roles and Daan started working mostly on the software, while I started working
              mostly on the prototype and design decissions. I asked Daan to spare me some wood that he had in his
              house, and after I got the pieces, I glued them to a frame that houses the iPad.

              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/frame-parts.jpg" alt=""><br><img

            </div>
            <p>
              (unfinished pattern, still need to add black )
            </p>
            <br>


            <p>
              After I've assambled the frame, I decided that in order to make the product lovable, I want to add a
              screen saver with some wavey colors that might intrigue users to approach it (e.g.)
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="images/screen-saver.webp" alt="">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>

              I also decided that adding amibent noise every 5 minutes for example is aslo a great addition into the
              lovable part. And finally I will be painting the frame in a pattern, just to add a little "spice" into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, I have recorded compliments for when the person has a "neutral" face and a "sad" face. I've asked
              some of my friends what they would like to hear if they were sad, and I added some of the suggestions they
              gave me.
