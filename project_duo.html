              Vision:
            </p>
            <p>
              During this DUO project, I have worked a lot on my vision, especially when it comes to impacting society
              and relationship with technology. During the brain storming pats of this project, I found myself steering
              into trying to help impaired people. For example, I wanted to make a hand gesturing keyboard by using the
              accelerator sensor and the raspberry pi, and the other idea was an eye-tracking keyboard meant for people
              who cannot use their arms, so the eye tracker would track the person's eyes and after standing on top of a
              certain letter, it will type it out. I have also worked on making sketches, discussing design ideas and making
              the product MLP by adding screen savers, ambient sounds and painting the frame, as well as adding "sad-face" specific compliments that would hopefully cheer the person up.

              Innovative concept:
            </p>
            <p>
              During this part of the project, I have worked intensively into researching the technology and human
              aspect, as well as creating concepts: that being both software and physical designs. I also believe that what we
              have created is innovative, in the sense that, it targets people’s emotions and tries to uplift them.

              Interactive user experience:
            </p>
            <p>
              I have researched extensively what the user experience should be, and came to the conclusion that the user
              should do as little as possible for the product to deliver what its expected to. We have also made a
              scaled-down installation, which resembles the ideal product in our vision.
              <br>

              Prototypes:
            </p>
            <p>
              I have prototyped in both software and hardware. I have made sure that the code works as intended, by
              doing usability tests and following standard testing procedure. I have also created user stories, use
              cases and an activity diagram. On top of partially creating the MVP, I am also in charge of creating the MLP
              of the product, which requires many changes, trying and failing. I'm also in charge of makin the final prototype which should resamble closest the real ideal product.

              Present:
            </p>
            <p>
              I strive to be good at presenting, and I always try to summarize my work in an easy to follow portfolio,
              and/or separate document. I have also explained my research outcomes, as in why we are using certain
              technologies and not others for example <p style="font-style: italic;">(document me and Daan made to explain design and tech decisions that I have attached in canvas).</p> 
              <p>
                Moreover, reflecting on what I have learned during this project
                is a vital tool to have, to check back on what went wrong and what went right.

              Personal growth:
            </p>
            <p>
              During this project, I feel that I have broadened my creative skill tool belt: vision,
              brainstorming, prototyping, user experience and overall trying to get out of my comfort zone. I also
              actively seeked feedback from teachers and when needed, students.
