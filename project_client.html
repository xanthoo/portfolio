              Vision:
            </p>
            <p>
              During the vision learning outcome I have focused most of my energy on answering questions such as: Why do
              people need this? What specifically do I want to change? What is the impact on people? What will be the
              effects of this in an utopian world?
              <br>
              I believe I have sufficiantly answered these question in the 2nd phase part in the timeline.
              <br>

              Innovative concept:
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that the way we are trying to tackle the sleep deprivation problem is unique beacuse of the
              personalisation of tips and/or methods of delivering such tips, like adding a human aspect into them <a
                href="https://the-microsoft-agent.fandom.com/wiki/Rover_The_Dog" target="_blank"> [perhaps a character
                simmilar to Rover The Dog for example].</a> I have also explained in more details our idea in the 3rd
              phase in the timeline.

              Interactive user experience:
            </p>
            <p>
              The user experience should come seamlessly as long as the user is wearing the FitBit watch and enables
              notifications on our app. The application will take care of sending notifications, personalised tips and
              vibrations if needed.

            <p>
              We have devided assignments equally, and are working to finish 3 POCs by the end of this week
              (30.06.2021). After successfuly finishing said POCs we will start working on a high-fi prototype, and
              ideally have a more or less finished product that matches our vision.

              After receiving feedback on this learning outcome from Geert Jan, I have stepped up my documentation
              writing skills, as refrenced in the 3rd phase part in the timeline, where I link a document comparing
              Ionic frameworks, their pros, cons and a conclusion. A reflection about this project will come in the last
              portfolio review since we have just started working.

              Personal growth:
            </p>
            <p>

              Throughout this semester I have made a list of some proffessional ambitions:
              <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Expanding my creativity and combining it with technology</p>

            <p>
              ◆ I believe that I've expanded my creativity during my Duo project with Daan, where I undertook the task of
              making it an MLP as well as designing the concept of the prototype.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Working with hardware</p>
            <p>
              ◆ Again, during the Duo project I worked on face recognition, as well as movement recognition, which
              required using a webcamera. I have also twinkled around with the distance sensor during brainstorming
              sessions.
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              ◆ During tihs project I will be working with the acceleration sensors on my phone, as well as the
              vibration motor on the phone.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Getting out of my comfort zone</p>
            
            <p>
              ◆ Admittedly, during the first project I stayed in my comfort zone, however after that, I took more of the
              creative part of the projects, like the MLP and sketching in the Duo project, as well as coming up with
              the idea for the current project, as well as researching human behavior and human habits. I started to
              focus more on "out of the box thinking" as well as brainstorming more than I ever had.
