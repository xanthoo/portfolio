              Vision:
            </p>
            <p>
              As mentioned in my previous portfolio, I believe that my vision has grately improved during this semester. I have attached a pdf called "Semester reflection" where I go into more detail. Thruought this project, I have tried to take the creative descisions as much as possible. For example, coming up with the idea, how we would like to use this idea, how it would impact people's lives, why we want people to get more sleep etc. I have researched forums, articles and videos related to sleep and its benefits. I also created the initial wireframes and layout of the application.

              Innovative concept:
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented some innovative ideas, such as the tracking of speed if a person is lacking enough sleep, and the constant vibration whenever the speed is above 30km/h. I have worked on the vibration part as well as helped with the speed tracking. Some of the creative thinking/processing involved were through other eyes, WWWWWH, wizard of Oz, paper prototyping (virtually, not on actual paper). I also explored many opportunities and failures through experimenting with different technologies, such as Ionic, or simply having limitations to the PWA framework, such as push notifications. Ultimately I succeeded at the tasks assigned to me by using a lot of experimenting, trials and errors.

              Interactive user experience:
            </p>
            <p>
              During the development of the app, we needed to paint a picture of what we want to have. We did this by creating requirments, user stories and MOSCOW. I have had many prototypes that are also documented in my timeline, such as experimenting with vibrations, different type of vibrtaions like patterns, researching speed tracking on phones, researching how to use the FitBit APIs, creating wireframes and the C4 architecture diagram. All of that has been iterated upon, based on feedback received from teachers. Our product can and will be experienced physically, as we will demonstrate it working live in my car with the teacher inside of it for a live demo.

              Prototypes:
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 4th phase of my timeline in the client project, I have explained how I worked with different technologies, until I found the most suitable one. I have also uploaded a video demo of the vibration working as a prototype, as well as a code snippet, demonstrating how it works. In the 5th phase, I have showed the wireframes that we worked on, as well as a requirments document, that has listed all user stories in a clear manner, as well as rated them using the MOSCOW method. In the 7th phase, I am demoing how we can use local storage in order to track the user's productivity, with screenshots from the console, as well as code snippets further explaining how the code looks like. In one of the images you can also see a notification on the screen, which actually also translates to the phone, and the phone also receives the notification.

              Present:
            </p>
            <p>
              For this learning outcome I have created many documents to support my claims as well as explaining my thought process and technical descisions.
              I have created a document briefly explaining the project in a storyline with highlighted words that colerate to the design process graph. I have also talked about my experience during the semester and how I have grown creatively during it in my "Semester reflection" document. Finally, I will present my work with a presentation at the building in Tilburg, but I will also make it more interactive by inviting the teachers to step into my car, as I will take them in a ride around the block, in order to demonstrate a working real life demo of our app.

              Personal growth:
            </p>
            <p>

              Throughout this semester I have made a list of some proffessional ambitions:
              <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Expanding my creativity and combining it with technology</p>

            <p>
              ◆ I can confidently say that I have expanded my vision and creativity during this semester, and combining it with technology seems to be more seemless. I am excited to start working on a personal project one day that will hopefully assit and help impaired people or children with disabilities. There are a lot of possibilities laying around, as long as you are dedicated into researching them. One of the projects I woud love to work on, that I have also previously mentioned will be the eye-tracking keyboard, where a user can simply look at a keyboard on screen and type by staring at a letter for long enough.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Working with hardware</p>
            <p>
              ◆ As a child I was never good with puzzles, legos or any hands-on toys. During my adulthood, I have strayed away from using hardware in technology aswell, however during some off-time in this semester I have been playing around with the arduino and raspberry pi, and found out that it gets really fun really fast. Experimenting with different sensors, leds makes it mutch more interactive, thus fun to use. I followed a tutorial for a parking sensor and it was lots of fun figuring out what goes where. Working with indirect hardware, such as the phone's components has proven to be also a lot of fun, testing out different possibilities, as well as limitations.
              
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Getting out of my comfort zone</p>
            
            <p>
              ◆ I can for certainty say that I have gotten out of my comfort zone in the second half of the semester. I have proactively looked for opportunitiesto do something related to creativity or vision. I have done sketches, physical prototypes, MLPs, wireframes, architecture documents, low-fi prototypes and paper prototypes. I have researched topics related to the projects I am working on, that being human aspects, how it will affect humanity, what if humanity does X Y Z, and so forth. I have learned how to develop my thought process into realistic ideas, I also learned how to brainstrom correctly, and also researched how to create personas and what they are used for, even though I do not have personas in either project.
